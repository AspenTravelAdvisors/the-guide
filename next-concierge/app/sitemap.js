// It used to list 147 URLs while the atlas held 11,102 stays and journeys,
// because there were no pages to list. There are now, for all of them: every
// property, every itinerary, every villa, and a hub above each. Answer pages
// carry their content's last-verified date.
//
// Villas are the exception, and the reason is worth stating because this file
// once went the other way. 3,902 villa detail pages existed with 114 of them
// listed here and nothing linking to the rest; the fix was hubs at /villas and
// /villas/<destination>, which is what a crawler is now pointed at. The detail
// pages under /atlas/villa are noindex, follow and are NOT listed — they are
// one template over one feed, 3,902 times, and the hubs above them say the same
// thing in text. Reachable, crawled, followed, deliberately not submitted.
