// GET /api/hotel/tw?ids=h_00001,h_00002 — the TravelWits identity for a batch
// of hotels, and nothing else.
//
// Why this exists: a "Search VIP rates" link can only auto-run the portal
// search when it carries the property's TravelWits hotelId + coordinates
// (lib/atlas/booking.js). That identity is attached server-side by
// lib/atlas/travelwits-overlay.js and is deliberately absent from the static
// point feed the globe downloads (public/maps/hotel/hotel-points.json), so
// without an endpoint the browse surface can only offer a link to *another*
// surface that has it — which is the extra hop this removes.
//
// Deliberately narrow: /api/hotel/luxury-hotels?ids= would answer the same
// question, but it returns the whole enriched record (description, benefits,
// ratings, fit) for every id — hundreds of kilobytes to build a link. This
// returns four fields per hotel and caches hard.
