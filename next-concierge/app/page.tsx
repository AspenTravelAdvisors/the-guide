/**
 * The home page's canonical, which did not exist.
 *
 * Every other indexable route sets `alternates.canonical` in its own metadata
 * and the root layout sets none — so the one page with the most inbound links
 * shipped no <link rel="canonical"> at all. That is not a cosmetic gap: the
 * origin is reachable as `/`, with a trailing-slash variant, and with whatever
 * query string the atlas's own Share button appends (?style, ?flat, ?@lat,lng),
 * and each of those is a separate URL to a crawler with nothing telling it
 * which one is the page.
 *
 * It is declared HERE rather than as a default in the root layout, and that is
 * the whole design decision. A canonical on the layout is inherited by every
 * descendant that does not override it, which would have pointed /atlas/hotel
 * and /atlas/villa at the home page — telling a crawler the atlas shells are
 * duplicates of `/` rather than pages of their own. Route-level is the only
 * altitude at which "this page is the home page" is a true statement.
 *
 * The relative "/" resolves against `metadataBase` in app/layout.tsx, which is
 * SITE_URL, which is NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL. One origin, one place to change it.

// reads those params itself, after mount, where they cost nothing. See
