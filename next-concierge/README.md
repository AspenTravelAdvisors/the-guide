# BeVvip Next Concierge

A Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) reimagining of the Base Camp concierge, and
since the promotion recorded in `PROMOTE.md` **the live site**. It is the only
application in this repository: the legacy static app that used to sit at the
repo root (`public/`, `api/*`, the root `vercel.json`) has been deleted, so the
rollback path that doc once described no longer exists. What remains outside
this directory is documentation (`Master Documents/`) and design mocks.

## What's here

- **`/` — The Guide.** Streaming chat concierge. The route handler at
  `app/api/guide/route.ts` ports `api/guide.js` to TypeScript using the
  official `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (replacing the hand-rolled SSE parser) and
  keeps the same Claude tool-use loop (`search_offerings` against the live
  Atlas APIs) and the same wire protocol
  (`status` → `delta`* → `meta` → `done`), so either frontend can talk to
  either backend during a migration.
- **Result cards + Atlas handoff.** The `meta` frame renders as inventory
  cards with per-result deep links, plus "View on the Living Atlas"
  (internal) and "Open full Atlas" (external) CTAs.
- **`/atlas/[type]` — unified Living Atlas.** One shell for
  `hotel | cruise | jet | yacht`, honoring the `?region=` deep-link contract
  from `DEEPLINK-HANDOFF.md`. Server-rendered with per-region metadata for
  SEO; tabs switch atlas type without losing the selected region. Renders
  the Mapbox dark globe when a token is present, otherwise an elegant
  fallback with the external-atlas handoff.

## Claude-only

This version is **Claude-only**. The Guide superseded the legacy OpenAI proxy
(`api/chat.js`), which has since been removed from the repo entirely.

## Run

```sh
cd next-concierge
npm install
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... npm run dev
```

## Environment

| Var | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | yes | The Guide (Claude) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | no* | The origin every absolute URL is built from — `metadataBase`, every canonical, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt` and every JSON-LD `@id`. Defaults to `https://guide.expeditionbucketlist.com` (see `SITE_URL` in `lib/answers.js`), so it is only *required* where that default would be a lie. *Set it in Vercel production, and set it on any preview or staging host that should emit its own URLs rather than production's — an unset preview publishes canonicals pointing at production. It is read at **build** time (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is inlined), so changing it needs a redeploy, not a restart. Trailing slashes are stripped; a value that is not an absolute origin fails the build at import. |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | no | Override the Guide's model (default `claude-sonnet-5-5`). A model the spend ceiling has no price for is metered at the most expensive known rate, so add it to `RATES` in `lib/guide-budget.ts` first. |
| `GUIDE_EFFORT` | no | How hard the Guide's model thinks: `low` (default), `medium`, `high` or `max`. `none` sends no effort at all; together with `CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6` it puts the Guide back on the model and settings it ran with before Sonnet 5.5. |
| `GUIDE_RATE_IP_MAX` | no | Guide turns one IP may start per minute (default 5). Keep it at most half of `GUIDE_RATE_GLOBAL_MAX`, or one caller can hold the whole route; `npm run verify:guide-budget` checks the defaults. |
| `GUIDE_RATE_GLOBAL_MAX` | no | Guide turns per minute across all callers (default 10). Counted only for turns that reach the model. |
| `GUIDE_RATE_DAILY_MAX` | no | Guide turns one IP may start per day (default 40). |
| `GUIDE_DAILY_BUDGET_USD` | no | The Guide's daily spend ceiling (default 25). See `lib/guide-budget.ts`. |
| `LEAD_RATE_MAX` / `LEAD_RATE_DAILY_MAX` / `LEAD_RATE_GLOBAL_MAX` | no | Advisor requests and bucket-list watches: per IP per minute (default 5), per IP per day (20), and across everyone per hour (60). See `lib/lead-inbox.ts`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` | no | Render the Living Atlas globe |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | no* | Google Maps JS key for the hotel map iframe (served via `/api/hotel/config`). *Required for the hotel map to render tiles. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_*_ATLAS_BASE` | no | Override the in-app atlas handoff path (default internal `/maps/<type>`; see `lib/atlas-config.ts`) |
| `PROJECT_EXPEDITION_TOKEN` | no* | Things to do — tours, private guides and day experiences from Project Expedition (`lib/experiences.js`, the Guide's `search_experiences` tool). *Unset means the Guide answers every "what is there to do here" with an advisor hand-off instead of real experiences. |
| `PE_API_BASE` | no | Project Expedition API base. **Defaults to staging** (`https://apistage.projectexpedition.com/v1`) — production deployments must set this to the live base, or they are showing staging inventory. |
| `PE_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | Abort a Project Expedition call after this many ms (default 8000; a country pull is ~2 MB and a cold function adds connect + TLS). |
| `BING_SITE_VERIFICATION` | no | The `msvalidate.01` value from Bing Webmaster Tools, if the site is verified there by meta tag (importing from Google Search Console needs nothing). Read at build time. Bing is notified of changed pages after each production deploy by `.github/workflows/indexnow.yml`. |

All atlas inventory and query logic is served in-process from `data/atlas/` + `lib/atlas/` — this app has no runtime dependency on the external `*.vercel.app` atlas deployments.

### Sync-time only (never read by the running site)

The Virtuoso Partner API credentials are needed by `npm run sync:virtuoso` and
by the nightly GitHub Action, and by nothing else. They belong in
`next-concierge/.env.local` locally (gitignored) and as **repository secrets**
for the Action — *not* in Vercel, which only builds committed data.

| Var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `VIRTUOSO_API_USER` | Agency name, passed as the `user` login parameter |
| `VIRTUOSO_API_KEY` | API key, encrypted into the auth token |
| `VIRTUOSO_API_AES_KEY` | AES-256-CBC key (base64) for the auth token |
| `VIRTUOSO_API_AES_IV` | AES-256-CBC IV (base64) for the auth token |
| `VIRTUOSO_API_BASE` | Optional override of `https://api.virtuoso.com` |

## Verification

```sh
npm run verify              # every check, all of them, failures named at the end
npm run verify:bail         # stop at the first failure
node scripts/verify-all.mjs virtuoso route   # just the ones whose name matches
node scripts/verify-all.mjs --skip=ports     # all but the ones whose name matches
```

`verify` deliberately does **not** stop at the first failure. It used to be an
`&&` chain, and a single false positive at the front took sixteen real checks
down with it — including one that was genuinely red. Each check is an
independent claim about a different part of the atlas, so each one runs.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the suite on every push to `main` and every
pull request. A check that goes red for a reason waiting on a person can run
there as its own non-blocking step (with `--skip` on the main one) rather than
being dropped.

## Supplier data

Virtuoso is the source of truth for hotel, promotion, cruise and tour facts.
The protocol — and the traps that cost real time — is written up in
`Master Documents/Virtuoso_API_Reference.md`.

The data is **committed, not fetched at request time**, so every supplier change
lands as a reviewable diff:

```
sync:virtuoso-hotels      ─┐
sync:virtuoso-promotions  ─┤  crawl  →  data/atlas/**/virtuoso-*.json   supplier truth
sync:virtuoso-cruises     ─┤
sync:virtuoso-tours       ─┘
                              ↓
match:virtuoso-hotels         →  data/atlas/hotel/virtuoso-id-map.json  ours ↔ theirs
merge:virtuoso-hotels         →  luxury-hotels.json                     truth + curation
merge:virtuoso-journeys       →  the six journey atlases
```

- `.github/workflows/virtuoso-sync.yml` runs the whole chain nightly and commits
  the result. Crawls resume from an NDJSON cache carried between runs, because a
  full detail crawl is thousands of strictly sequential calls.
- `npm run verify:virtuoso` checks that the feeds are fresh and that the merged
  outputs are current with respect to them.
- `prebuild` re-runs the merges on every deploy, so date-sensitive content
  (expired offers, departed sailings) is always filtered as of the build.
