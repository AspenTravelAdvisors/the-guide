// The footer — a server-rendered set of links, which the site did not have.
//
// Worth stating plainly, because it looks like decoration and is not: every
// path into the inventory ran through SiteNav's Explore menu, which renders its
// links only after a click. A crawler (or an answer engine, or a visitor with
// JS still loading) arriving on the home page found "The Guide", "Answers",
// "How this works" and a map canvas. The 2,240 property pages, the seven
// atlases and the country hubs were reachable only from the sitemap, and a URL
// that nothing links to is a URL search treats as an orphan.
//
// So these are the same destinations the menu offers, in plain HTML, at the
// foot of every document route. NOT in the root layout: `.app` is pinned to
// 100dvh and never scrolls, because the atlas fills the stage edge to edge —
// a footer there would take a strip off the map on every page. It goes inside
// the surfaces that scroll, which are exactly the surfaces a crawler reads.
