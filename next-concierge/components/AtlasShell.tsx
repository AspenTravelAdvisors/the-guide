// Without a Mapbox token it degrades to an elegant fallback panel with the

 *
 * ── The thing that cannot be done ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no camera position that puts a round-the-world itinerary on a
 * phone, in either projection, and no amount of tuning the fit changes that.
 *
 * Mercator's floor is minZoom: at 0.6 the whole world is 512·2^0.6 ≈ 776px
 * wide against a map band about 350px across, so less than half a planet fits
 * and the itinerary runs off both edges — which is what "the private jet round
 * the world routes can't fit on the screen" is. Lowering minZoom does not
 * rescue it either: the world is 512px at zoom 0 and there is nothing below
 * that. A globe shows at most a hemisphere, and the outer ~30° of that is
 * edge-on, so it frames about 110° — which is what SPAN_FLAT_LNG encodes.
 *
 * ── So don't frame it, fly it ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Framing is what the card tap does, as well as it can. The flight is a
 * separate, deliberate act, and it is built out of ONE beat repeated:
 *
 *     land on the call · name it · hold · hop to the next
 *
 * ── Why a hop, and not a pan ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first version flew the whole itinerary as one continuous pass at a single
 * altitude, and paid for the distance with speed. It was too fast to watch, and
 * it could not have been fixed by slowing down: at an altitude close enough to
 * recognise a city, a Pacific crossing is 9,000km of empty water, and any speed
 * that crosses it in reel time is a speed that makes the cities unreadable.
 *
 * So distance is paid for with ALTITUDE instead. Each leg rises out of one
 * call, crosses at a height that frames the whole leg, and descends into the
 * next — the arc a flight actually makes, and the one thing that lets the
 * empty middle go past quickly while the ends stay legible. The dwell at each
 * call is what the whole flight is FOR: the map holds still, the call names
 * itself, and there is time to read it.
 *
 * A leg's duration follows how far it climbs, not how far it travels: a hop
 * down the Riviera barely leaves the ground and takes about a second and a
 * half, a Tokyo → Los Angeles crossing climbs four zoom levels and takes three
 * and a half. Which means a route's length is set by its number of CALLS, not
 * by its span — an eight-call world tour and an eight-call Mediterranean
 * itinerary run to about the same length, and both are watchable.
 *
 * ── North stays up ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Deliberately no rotation. Turning the camera to face along each leg is the
 * seat-back-map idiom and it costs more than it pays here: every city label on
 * the basemap arrives at a different angle, and a viewer who looked away for a
 * beat has to re-find north before they can read where they are. The tilt and

 * makes the camera stop every four days in the Caribbean and every fortnight
 * across the Pacific, which is precisely the reading a voyage does not want.
 * A week is the beat a world cruise is actually lived and sold in, the shipped
 * itineraries carry a day number on every call, and it makes the LENGTH of the
 * flight say something true: a 72-day voyage flies eleven landings, a 133-day
 * voyage nineteen. Measured over the 250 shipped voyages, weeks per itinerary
 * run p10 8, median 11, p90 19.
 *
 * The ROUTE is still drawn and still flown over in full. Only the pauses thin.
 *
 * The tail of the expedition atlas (its longest is 79 ports) will therefore run
 * long. That is deliberate: it is one sailing in a hundred, the traveller asked
 * for the flight, and the control says "Stop" for as long as it runs.

 * reads as jitter — the picture never settles and never opens out, and the

 * So a merged leg always rises: the camera pulls back far enough to hold the

 * ── Why the camera does not simply follow the line ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Because the line is a real one. A jet leg is an analytic great-circle loft
 * with no detail below the scale of the journey, which is why that atlas
 * always looked right and the other three did not. Rail track and routed sea
 * lanes are surveyed geometry, and they wobble far below the scale the flight
 * is about — so a camera pinned to the line inherits every kink in the survey.
 *
 * Measured by walking each shipped leg at 60fps exactly as the flight does and
 * taking the camera's screen-space acceleration, in px/frame² (rms, and the
 * worst frame of the leg), on a 1263px map:
 *
 *                             following the line     following this path
 *     rail                     4.98   worst 14.11     1.08   worst 2.67
 *     sea / expedition         2.61   worst  8.85     1.23   worst 3.15
 *     sea / world cruise       2.24   worst  8.70     1.18   worst 2.96
 *     sea / yacht              1.96   worst  7.13     1.12   worst 2.78
 *
 * The number that sizes the constant is the CONTROL: a perfectly straight leg,
 * flown with the same climb and the same ramp, reads 0.87 rms / 2.16 worst.
 * That is the floor — motion the flight is supposed to have, and no survey can
 * remove it. Smoothed, every collection sits within about a third of that
 * floor, which says the surveyed shake is gone and what is left is the camera
 * doing its job. Smoothing harder from here would stop taking out wobble and
 * start taking out the route.
 *
 * Expressed against the FRAME rather than in kilometres, because whether a
 * wobble is visible is a question about the picture and never about the
 * ground. The cost is that the camera no longer sits exactly over the line:
 * worst case across the shipped legs, 12–18px at reading altitude, or about
 * 1.4% of the frame. The line still runs through the middle of the picture.
 *
 * The DRAWN route is untouched. The trail follows the surveyed line exactly,
 * because that line is the product's claim about where the train goes; only
 * the camera is allowed to take the smooth way round it.

         *   - legs no hop claimed, appended after the route in source order. A
         *     camera walking the concatenation flies the itinerary, then jumps
         *     back and flies an orphan as though it came next.

         *     closes that gap with a straight line, so the camera cuts across
         *     whatever lies between two ports while the drawing beneath it
         *     shows no such leg.
         *
         * So take the hops route-frame actually claimed, in hop order, and fly
         * each one along its own coordinates. What the camera traverses is then
         * the same geometry the map is drawing, by construction — and the leg
         * knows which stops it runs between without any nearest-point guessing.
         *
         * A route with no itinerary behind it (route-frame fell back to its

 * starts a little further along. Sliding the phase forward makes the breaks
