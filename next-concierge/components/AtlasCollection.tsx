 * A collection browsed on the globe — the replacement for one iframed Leaflet

 * introducing a fourth map product:

 *   AtlasShell        the Mapbox globe, scoped to this collection's layer
 *   adapters/*        itinerary.json → AtlasOffering[] (parity-tested)
 *   params.ts         deep links in, Share links out (parity-tested)
 *   AtlasFilterRail   one rail, driven by the descriptor
 *
 * The globe shows ambient region pins plus ONE traced route — the interaction
 * the Leaflet atlases had. It deliberately does not reuse The Guide's
 * `bevvip:atlas-plot` path; see the note above the trace helpers for why.
 *
 * The URL is the source of truth for filter state. Every change rewrites the
 * query string, so the browser's Share/copy-URL gives a link identical in shape
 * to the ones the old Share buttons produced — and every link those buttons
 * ever produced still parses (see D3-FILTER-INVENTORY.md).
