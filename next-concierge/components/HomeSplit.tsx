// Maps' desktop grammar. Its width drags at the right edge (persisted), a tab
// on that edge collapses it to a floating "Ask The Guide" pill for full-map
// immersion, and the collapsed/open state is the home--panel-closed class.
//
// Phones (≤640px): the chat is a bottom sheet with three detents — parked
// off-screen behind the atlas dock's pill, half-height (map animating above),
// or nearly full for reading — driven by the home--sheet-* classes. The two
// state machines are independent; each breakpoint's CSS reads only its own.
//
// Whenever either state changes the panel/sheet footprint, we dispatch
// "bevvip:atlas-refit" so the atlas re-frames plotted results (and recenters
// its ambient camera) into the strip of map that remains visible.
