/**
 * Safari Journeys on the globe.
 *
 * Deliberately thin, like the rail and jet collections it sits beside: it knows
 * how to fetch and adapt one feed and hands everything else to AtlasCollection.
 *
 * The one thing it does differently is the route. Rail draws real track
 * polylines and the sea atlases draw routed lanes, because a train and a ship
 * are constrained to a network. A safari is not: the leg from the Mara to the
 * Serengeti is a light aircraft, and the leg from camp to camp is a Land
 * Cruiser on tracks no map has. Drawing an invented road would be a lie with a
 * confident line on it, so the stops are joined directly — the same honesty the
 * rail atlas applies to its own gaps.
