/**
 * Private Jet Journeys on the globe — second collection off its Leaflet iframe.
 *
 * Thin, as intended: the only thing jet knows that rail doesn't is how its own
 * geometry works.
 *
 * **Jets arc, trains don't.** Rail ships real track polylines and drawing a
 * bezier over Loch Lomond instead of the West Highland Line is a lie. An
 * aircraft genuinely does fly the arc, and a straight line between two cities
 * reads as a wire rather than a journey.
 *
 * But it flies a SPECIFIC arc. The sea router's `arcPts` bezier is a fine
 * chart convention for a short coastal hop and the wrong thing here, because a
 * flight path is a great circle and anyone who has watched a seat-back map
 * knows what one looks like. Worse, the bezier's bulge follows the leg's
 * direction, so a return leg bowed south — Los Angeles → Tokyo dipped past
 * Hawaii, and an out-and-back itinerary drew a lens rather than a path.
 * `geodesicLine` draws the track the aircraft actually flies.
 *
 * Legs are unrolled before arcing, for the same reason the sea router unrolls:
 * arcing a raw Tokyo → Los Angeles pair sweeps west across Asia and Africa
 * instead of east across the Pacific.
