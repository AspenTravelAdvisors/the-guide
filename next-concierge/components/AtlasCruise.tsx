/**
 * Expedition Cruises on the globe — the fifth and last collection, and the one
 * that shares no adapter family.
 *
 * Feature-checked against D3-FEATURE-INVENTORY.md before porting:
 *
 *   source    THREE files, not one. `sailings.json` is columnar
 *             (`{schema, rows}`, 3,542 rows), `atlas-meta.json` carries
 *             OPERATORS/REGIONS, and `data/itinerary-routes.json` the day-by-day
 *             ports. Hence `adaptCruise(sailings, meta, routes)` rather than the
 *             single-argument adapters the other four use.
 *   geometry  Deliverable 1's precompute covers 2,829 of 3,542 sailings — the
 *             gap is exactly the 712 whose route ports are all un-geocoded, so
 *             there is nothing to draw for them and nothing missing.
 *   accent    #5aa9e6 — and here it MATCHES AtlasShell's OVERLAYS entry. The
 *             mismatch was yacht and worldcruise only; cruise is consistent.
 *   ships     filtered from the sailings dataset's own `ship` column, which is
 *             what WORKORDER-expedition-ship-data.md Deliverable 4 asks for:
 *             "a true per-sailing filter … sourced from the sailings, not from
 *             ships.json". The port satisfies that by construction —
 *             AtlasFilterRail derives ship options from the offerings.
 *             `ships.json` stays enrichment-only, as that work order intends.
