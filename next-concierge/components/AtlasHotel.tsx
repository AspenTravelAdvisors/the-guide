/**
 * VIP Hotels — one surface, two engines.
 *
 * Deliverable 2 shipped this as a SPLIT: browse on the Mapbox globe here,
 * inspect in Google Photorealistic 3D over in `public/maps/hotel/index.html`,
 * reached by opening a new tab. The engineering was right and the placement was
 * wrong. The work order's own words are why:
 *
 *   > Mapbox has no equivalent (its "3D buildings" are extruded footprints — a
 *   > grey block where the hotel is). For a luxury travel product this is the
 *   > single most persuasive thing the app does. It stays.
 *
 * A thing that persuasive should not be three clicks and a tab away. So the
 * split is now along the camera, not along the page: photoreal is an ENGINE
 * CHOICE on this map (see AtlasShell's `photoreal` prop and Atlas3DLayer),
 * carrying the filters, the selection and the camera across the switch. The
 * hotel atlas's own numbers still define where each engine earns its keep —
 * DETAIL_TILT engages at DETAIL_RANGE = 2,600 m and eases flat by 220 km —
 * they just no longer imply two destinations.
 *
 *   BROWSE   2,501 hotels, filtered by category, program, country and
 *            macro-region, on whichever engine is drawing.
 *   INSPECT  a card or a pin opens the property dossier and flies to the
 *            building; on the photoreal engine that is the real building, in
 *            photogrammetry mesh. The `?hotel=<id>` deep link lands there
 *            directly — reliable since the camera-race fix in STATE.md, which
 *            Atlas3DLayer ports along with the rest of the camera.
 *
 * Hotels are the first collection whose filter grammar genuinely differs from
 * the five retired atlases; every divergence is documented in
 * lib/atlas/adapters/hotel.ts and asserted by scripts/verify-hotels.mjs
 * (1.75M comparisons against the original predicate).
 *
 * Nothing here touches GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, /api/hotel/config, or the
 * /maps/hotel/api/* rewrite — all three must survive, per the work order's
 * "three things that will look like cleanup and are not".
