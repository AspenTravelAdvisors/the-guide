/**
 * World Cruises on the globe — fourth collection off its Leaflet iframe.
 *
 * The prediction held: worldcruise is config. Its adapter is `voyage.ts`
 * unchanged, its predicate is byte-identical to yacht's apart from the `wc_`
 * prefix, and this file differs from AtlasYacht only in the feed paths, the
 * accent, and the fact that it has no bundled logo assets.
 *
 * Feature-checked before porting, per D3-FEATURE-INVENTORY.md:
 *
 *   geometry  Deliverable 1's precompute covers ALL 250 voyages — 3,017 legs,
 *             the densest of the three sea files. No live A*, no land mask.
 *   accent    #3fc1b0, the atlas's own --accent. Differs from AtlasShell's
 *             OVERLAYS entry (#45d6c2); the atlas's own value wins, as with
 *             yacht (#caa44e vs #e0b84a). Worth assuming this holds for cruise
 *             too rather than trusting OVERLAYS.
 *   logos     no bundled assets — the favicon services and the coloured-initials
 *             fallback in BrandLogo carry all 13 lines on their own.
 *   ports     971, resolved EXACTLY (voyage family), so the type-ahead matters
 *             more here than anywhere except cruise.
