Complex custom itineraries are the exception, where a planning fee is normal.",

      "For luxury hotels, cruises and villas: no — in most cases you pay the same published rate you'd find yourself, the supplier pays the advisor a commission from its marketing budget, and the advisor's programs add benefits on top. At the {{collection:hotel}} hotels in our atlas, an advisor booking layers upgrade priority, daily breakfast, and property credits (typically $100+) onto the hotel's own flexible rate — value the DIY booking simply doesn't receive. On expedition cruises and villas the rate parity works the same way.",
      "Where fees do exist, they're for labor, not access: many advisors (ours included) charge planning fees for complex multi-stop itineraries, air-ticketing, or bespoke trip design — disclosed up front, often credited against the trip. The scenario where DIY genuinely wins is narrow: prepaid nonrefundable discount rates, points redemptions, and opaque-channel gambles, all of which trade away flexibility, benefits, or certainty.",
