    capsule:
      "Yes, the luxury expedition ships are real expedition ships: Seabourn's and Silversea's carry 20-plus-person expedition teams, proper Zodiac fleets and ice-classed hulls, and land guests under the same IAATO rules as anyone else. What they trade is opportunism — 200–264 guests means rotated landings and a service schedule that sits less easily with weather that changes by the hour.",
    answer: [
      "Yes — it's real. Seabourn's and Silversea's expedition ships carry 20-plus-person expedition teams, proper Zodiac fleets and PC6 ice-classed hulls, and they land you on the same beaches under the same IAATO rules as anyone else. The penguins do not check your thread count. What the luxury tier trades is a degree of expedition opportunism: bigger ships (200–264 guests) mean rotated landings, and a service schedule built around dinner sits less comfortably with 'the bears are here NOW' than a field-first operation like Quark or Aurora.",

If the trip must also be a holiday — a couple where one person is being persuaded, an anniversary, anyone allergic to bunk-adjacent bathrooms — the luxury tier is precisely what gets that second traveler to Antarctica happily, and it loses surprisingly little. The failure mode is only ever mismatch: hardcore travelers feeling scheduled on a luxury ship, or comfort travelers feeling weathered on a field ship.",

    faqs: [
      {
        q: "Do luxury expedition ships land less often?",
        a: "Marginally. A 264-guest ship rotates guests through the 100-ashore limit, so each landing window per guest is shorter than on a 130-guest ship. Over ten days that compounds to a real but not ruinous difference — and scenic days are identical.",

      {
        q: "Is the food really that different?",
        a: "Yes. Expedition-first lines feed you well; Ponant, Seabourn and Silversea feed you like their classic fleets — multiple venues, serious cellars, caviar on the ice as a set piece. If that sentence made you roll your eyes, you've self-selected.",
      },
      {
        q: "Which is better for a solo traveler?",
        a: "Expedition-first ships have stronger communal culture (shared tables, open bridges, recap-bar camaraderie) and more single-friendly cabin math on older ships. Luxury lines increasingly court solos with reduced supplements on select polar departures — ask your advisor which departures are running them.",
