// Answer pages — safari.
//
// The collection had no answers at all, and the reason is worth recording
// because it was structural rather than an oversight of subject matter: safari
// shipped as the eighth atlas with pins on the globe, a colour, a page and a
// menu entry, but with no query backend — so The Guide could not search it, and
// `category: "Safari"` was not in CATEGORY_ORDER, so an answer filed under it
// would have been dropped from /answers without a word. Both are fixed; these
// are the first two answers that could exist.
//
// Counts are queries (lib/seo/facts.mjs), not typed numbers — both halves now.
// `{{hotels:…}}` queries the hotel feed for the LODGES; `{{journeys:…}}` and
// `{{departures:…}}` query data/atlas/shared/journey-facts.json for the
// ITINERARIES. The two journey tokens exist because both numbers are true and
// they differ: safari holds 250 itineraries and 274 departures, expedition
// cruise 902 and 3,662. Writing the departure count and linking to the
// itinerary pages is the kind of near-miss that makes a page look wrong to
// somebody checking it.

Wilderness and andBeyond do: their itineraries move you between their own properties, which is why their Botswana and Okavango trips run so smoothly and why their guiding is consistent from camp to camp. Abercrombie & Kent and Micato do not own most of the camps but own the logistics — the charters, the ground teams, the airport fixers — which is what East Africa actually runs on, and why they dominate Kenya and Tanzania. Ker & Downey, Artisans of Leisure and Remote Lands sit at the bespoke end: fewer scheduled departures, more of a trip designed around your dates.",
