// The crawlable hotel entity layer.
//
// Until now the 2,240 properties in the atlas existed for a crawler only as a
// number in a sentence. The map is a client component, the dossier fetches
// `/api/hotel/luxury-hotels/:id`, and robots.txt disallows `/api/` — so every
// fact the Virtuoso sync brought in (the year-stamped benefits, the supplier's
// own description, the coordinates, the room counts, the live promotions) was
// invisible to search and to answer engines alike. An answer page could say
// "1,930 Virtuoso properties" and there was no page anywhere naming one.
//
// This module is the server-side half of the fix: one stable URL per property,
// resolved from the same merged feed the atlas queries, plus the schema.org
// description of it. The pages themselves are app/hotels/**.
//
// Server-only. Never import from a "use client" file: it pulls the 11MB feed.
