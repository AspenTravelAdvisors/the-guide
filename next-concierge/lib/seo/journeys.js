// The crawlable journey entity layer — the six route atlases.
//
// Same argument as lib/seo/hotels.js, one collection family over: 4,960
// departures across expedition cruises, world cruises, yacht voyages, rail,
// jets and safaris, every one of them rendered by a client component fed from
// a feed no crawler is allowed to read.
//
// ── One page per ITINERARY, not per departure ──────────────────────────────
//
// This is the decision worth defending, because the obvious implementation is
// the wrong one. The cruise feed holds 3,662 sailings and 902 distinct
// operator-plus-itinerary pairs: "Exploring Galápagos" alone appears 235 times,
// once per departure date, identical in every other respect. A page per sailing
// would have published 235 pages differing only in a date — the textbook
// definition of thin, near-duplicate content, and the fastest way to have the
// whole /journeys tree discounted.
//
// So a page is an itinerary and the departures are a table on it. That is
// better for a reader too: "when does this sail" is a question the page can now
// answer completely, instead of 235 pages each answering it once. Yacht
// collapses 467 → 347 the same way; the other four are nearly all distinct
// already and collapse barely at all, which is itself the evidence that the
// grouping key is the right one.
//
// The offerings come from the REAL adapters — the same adaptCruise/adaptVoyage/
// adaptJourney the atlases run — so a page and the map agree about what a
// journey is. Anything the adapters deliberately drop (they normalize for
// filtering and drawing, not for prose) is read back off the raw record here,
// which is why both are loaded.
//
// Server-only: this pulls every route feed.
