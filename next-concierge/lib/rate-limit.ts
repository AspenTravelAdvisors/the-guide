// next-concierge/lib/rate-limit.ts — best-effort rate limiting for the Guide.
// Ported from the legacy lib/guide-rate-limit.js, adapted to the App Router's
// Web Request/Response.
//
// TWO BACKENDS, chosen by environment (see lib/kv.ts for the transport):
//
//   Distributed (preferred) — set UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL and
//     UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN and every instance shares one counter, which is
//     the only way a limit actually holds on serverless. Vercel KV exposes the
//     same REST shape under KV_REST_API_URL / KV_REST_API_TOKEN; both are read.
//
//   In-memory (fallback) — a per-instance Map. Vercel functions are stateless
//     across instances, so this throttles a burst from one client on one warm
//     instance but is NOT a global guarantee: a flood spread across cold starts
//     slips past it. It is a backstop that raises the cost of casual abuse.
//
// The fallback also catches the distributed path failing: if the store errors
// or times out we fall back to the local counter rather than failing open, so a
// Redis outage degrades the limit instead of removing it.
//
// TWO LIMITS, and they answer different attacks:
//
//   Per-IP (`max`) — stops one client hammering the endpoint.
//
//   Global (`globalMax`) — stops the attack the per-IP limit structurally
//     cannot see. On 19 September the Guide took 1,359 requests in two hours
//     from a residential-proxy pool spread across twenty-odd countries; no
//     single IP came close to 10/min, so the per-IP counter never fired once
//     while the endpoint burned the whole Anthropic balance. A ceiling on the
//     ROUTE, not the caller, is the only limiter shape that sees that traffic.
//     It is deliberately blunt — during an attack it will turn away real
//     travelers too. That is the correct trade for an endpoint that spends
//     money per call, and it is why the Guide also carries a spend ceiling
//     (lib/guide-budget.ts) rather than relying on this alone.
