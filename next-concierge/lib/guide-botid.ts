// next-concierge/lib/guide-botid.ts — server half of BotID. ENFORCING.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES TODAY: classifies the caller, and the Guide refuses to spend a
// model round on one classified as automated — handing that visitor to an
// advisor instead of returning an error. See app/api/guide/route.ts.
//
// This ran in shadow mode first, and the shadow data is why it is enforcing.
// Across the sample every single turn came back "bot", each one carrying the
// flood's own signature: ref guide.expeditionbucketlist.com, a scatter of
// countries (PK, BD, AZ, DZ, ID) no luxury-travel book has, several a second.
// The classifier and the attack agreed completely.
//
// What that sample does NOT contain is a confirmed human turn, because the
// flood is nearly all the traffic there is right now. So the false positive
// rate is still unmeasured, and the hand-off below is not a nicety — it is the
// thing standing in for evidence we do not have yet. Watch `"bot"` verdicts
// arriving from plausible countries on plausible referrers; that is the signal
// that this is catching real people, and the reason to loosen it.
//
// WHY SHADOW FIRST. On 19 September a proxy-pool flood drove /api/guide from
// ~25 turns a day to 1,767 and drained the Anthropic balance. Rate limits and
// the daily ceiling meter that; only knowing who is calling prevents it. But
// the cost of being wrong is lopsided here in a way it is not for most sites:
// this endpoint fronts a luxury travel agency where one conversation can be a
// five-figure booking, so wrongly turning away a real client costs far more
// than serving a bot. A classifier is worth enforcing only once its false
// positive rate on OUR traffic is known, and the only way to know is to watch
// it be right or wrong for a while without acting on it.
//
// READING THE RESULT. Every turn logs `bot` on its guide_turn line:
//
//   "bot":"human"     — classified human. What almost every real turn should say.
//   "bot":"bot"       — would have been refused had this been enforcing.
//   "bot":"verified"  — a declared agent (ChatGPT Operator and friends), with
//                       the name in `botName`. NOT abuse by default: this
//                       business runs an AI travel guide, and a real prospect
//                       researching through an agent is a lead, not a scraper.
//   "bot":"unknown"   — the check could not run. Never treated as either.
//
// The number that decides whether to enforce is the share of `"bot"` verdicts
// carrying a referrer and country consistent with real travelers. Compare it
// against the flood's own signature — `ref: guide.expeditionbucketlist.com`
// from twenty-odd countries at a few requests a second.
//
// WHEN ENFORCING: do NOT return 403 to the browser. Refuse to spend the model
// tokens, then hand the visitor to an advisor instead of an error. A
// misclassified client still reaches a person, a bot still gets nothing spent
// on it, and the failure mode of the whole feature stops being "lose the
// customer" and becomes "route the customer to a human" — which for this
// business is a defensible outcome on its own.
