/**
 * The Google Photorealistic 3D engine, as a module the app can mount anywhere.
 *
 * Until now this engine existed only inside `public/maps/hotel/index.html` — a
 * standalone vanilla-JS page reachable through an iframe. That is why the most
 * persuasive view in the product sat a layer down: an iframe cannot share
 * filters, chrome or camera with the shell around it, so "browse" and "inspect"
 * could only ever be two pages.
 *
 * This module is the half of the port that has no React in it: loading the Maps
 * JS API, the camera arithmetic, and the types. `components/Atlas3DLayer.tsx`
 * mounts it; `AtlasShell` offers it as an engine beside the Mapbox basemaps.
 *
 * Everything here is ported behaviour, not new behaviour. Where a constant came
 * from the original it is named and cited, because the original's camera is
 * tuned — `DETAIL_RANGE` / `DETAIL_TILT` are what makes a property arrival feel
 * cinematic rather than like a zoom.
 */

/* ── Minimal types for the Maps 3D web components ───────────────────────────
 *
 * @types/google.maps does not ship `maps3d` (it is a `v=beta` library), so the
 * alternative to these is `any` at every call site. Only the surface this app
 * touches is declared — enough that a typo is a compile error rather than a
 * silent no-op at runtime.

 * containing a large resort's grounds at DETAIL_TILT. Closer than ~250 m and a
 * tall property starts to overrun the frame; further than ~800 m and you are

 *
 * So the duration follows the distance, and it is linear in the LOG of it,
 * because that is how the move reads rather than how far it is: crossing a city
 * and crossing an ocean are both one gesture, and an ocean is not two thousand
 * times as much of one. A hop across town lands at ~2.6s, a hop across the
 * country around 4.5s, and the far side of the world at 5.2s — slow enough to
 * be a journey, short enough that nobody clicking through a shortlist is
