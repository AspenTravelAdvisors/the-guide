/**
 * Expedition Cruises — the outlier, and the last of the five.
 *
 * Everything about this collection is its own case, which is why it is ported
 * last and why it does not reuse voyage.ts:
 *
 *   source      COLUMNAR. public/maps/cruise/sailings.json is
 *               `{schema: [...names], rows: [[...values]]}` — 3,542 rows
 *               expanded through the schema index — plus atlas-meta.json for
 *               OPERATORS/REGIONS and data/itinerary-routes.json for geometry.
 *   brand       there is none. It filters on `operator`, and its Share button
 *               emits `operator=` where its siblings emit `brand=`.
 *   region      a SCALAR display name ("Hawaii & Tahiti"), not a key array —
 *               and it is REWRITTEN, because the feed's region column is a
 *               marketing bucket rather than a place. region-overrides.json
 *               (scripts/build-cruise-regions.mjs) carries every sailing's
 *               region, read off its own geocoded ports; the title rules in
 *               correctedRegionName() remain as the fallback for a feed row the
 *               overlay has not seen. Filtering on the raw column value puts
 *               Chilean fjords under Norway.
 *   past cutoff `s.start >= today` on an ISO string, so a dateless sailing is
 *               dropped (see requiresStartDate) rather than kept.
 *   stops       ONLY geocoded ports count. 712 of 3,542 sailings have a route
 *               whose ports are all un-geocoded, giving them an empty port set
 *               — the port filter genuinely cannot match them. yacht behaves
 *               the opposite way, counting every named call.
 *   haystack    [name, operator, ship, region] only. No ports, no brand.
 *
 * Coordinate with WORKORDER-expedition-ship-data.md, which is changing the ship
 * filter for this collection.
