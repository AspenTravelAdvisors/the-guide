// next-concierge/lib/guide-budget.ts — a hard daily ceiling on what the Guide
// may spend with Anthropic.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. On 19 September /api/guide went from its normal ~25 requests
// a day to 1,767, with 1,359 of them inside two hours, and drained the account's
// credit balance; every request after that returned "Your credit balance is too
// low to access the Anthropic API". Nothing in the stack had an opinion about
// total spend — the rate limiter counted requests per IP, and the traffic came
// from a proxy pool spread across twenty-odd countries where no single IP was
// anywhere near the limit.
//
// A request limiter answers "is this caller going too fast". It cannot answer
// "have we spent too much today", because the cost of a turn is not knowable
// until the turn is over: a one-round answer and a six-round cross-atlas sweep
// differ by an order of magnitude. So this counts DOLLARS, after the fact, and
// refuses new turns once the day's total is past the ceiling.
//
// The ceiling is a circuit breaker, not a budget manager. When it trips the
// Guide stops answering anyone, and it stays stopped until UTC midnight or
// until someone raises GUIDE_DAILY_BUDGET_USD. That is a deliberately harsh
// failure mode: an endpoint that has already spent the day's money is not one
// to leave running while the balance drains.
//
// ACCURACY. Spend is recorded from the usage Anthropic actually reports, so it
// is exact for the tokens it sees. What it cannot see is the round in flight
// when a turn is cut off — by its own deadline (see the Guide route) or by the
// function timeout — whose tokens are billed and never counted. The ceiling therefore runs slightly UNDER real spend, which is the
// right direction for a safety limit but means it should not be read as a bill.
