// lib/analytics.ts — the lead funnel, in one place.
//
// Every design decision in this app was previously argued from taste, because
// nothing was measured. These are the five moments that decide whether Base
// Camp works as a lead engine, in order:
//
//   ask_sent → results_returned → advisor_cta_clicked → advisor_request_sent
//
// with booking_clicked as the parallel self-serve path. Anything that isn't on
// one of those two paths does not belong in this file: a metric nobody will act
// on is noise that makes the real numbers harder to read.
//
// Vercel Analytics only records custom events in production with the
// <Analytics /> component mounted (see app/layout.tsx). In dev, `track` is a
// no-op, so calling these is always safe.
