/**
 * Rebuild the expedition-cruise region overlay.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The `region` column in sailings.json is the supplier feed's own marketing
 * bucket, and several of its buckets are keyword buckets rather than places.
 * "Norway, Fjords & Coast" is the worst: it collects anything with "fjord" in
 * the title, so Chilean Patagonia, Greenland, Iceland and the Alaskan Inside
 * Passage all landed under Norway. The Region filter in the atlas is built from
 * these values, so a traveller filtering to Norway was shown Chile.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 * Every sailing already carries day-by-day geocoded ports (itinerary-routes.json,
 * built by the Expedition Atlas route work). Those ports are the ground truth:
 * each port name ends in its country ("Puerto Montt, Chile", "Bergen, Norway"),
 * so a port can be placed on the map with no guessing. This script tallies each
 * sailing's ports into regions and takes the answer from the itinerary itself.
 * Sailings whose ports are all un-geocoded (712 of 3,542) fall back to title
 * keywords, then to the endpoint cities in the title.
 *
 * The output is an overlay — every sailing's region, grouped by region name —
 * NOT a rewrite of sailings.json. The feed stays the feed, so a re-import cannot
 * silently revert the fix, and re-running this script after an import refreshes
 * the overlay.
 *
 *   node scripts/build-cruise-regions.mjs            # write the overlay
 *   node scripts/build-cruise-regions.mjs --dry-run  # report, write nothing
 *   node scripts/build-cruise-regions.mjs --check    # exit 1 if stale (CI)
 *
 * Writes (both copies — data/ is what the server lib requires, public/ is what
 * the browser fetches):
 *   data/atlas/cruise/region-overrides.json
 *   public/maps/cruise/region-overrides.json
 * and refreshes REGIONS (counts, plus coords for regions the feed never had) in
 * both atlas-meta.json copies.
