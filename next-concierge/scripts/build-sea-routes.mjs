/**
 * build-sea-routes — precompute every sea leg once, at build time.
 *
 * Before this, each of the cruise / yacht / worldcruise Leaflet atlases shipped
 * a 765 KB land mask to every visitor and ran A* in the main thread on demand.
 * That was survivable when one atlas showed one collection. On a unified globe
 * asking for 3,542 expedition sailings + 250 world cruises + 374 yacht voyages
 * at once, it is not.
 *
 * So: route here, ship geometry. The land mask never reaches the browser.
 *
 * The win is de-duplication. Many voyages share legs — Miami -> George Town is
 * sailed by dozens of ships. Keying on the router's own 2-decimal leg key
 * collapses 54,076 raw legs to ~8,335 unique ones, a 6.5x reduction, and the
 * survivors carry a tripIds list so a single voyage can still be picked out.
 *
 * Legs are grouped by collection type because AtlasShell paints one route layer
 * per overlay key (r_<key>_line), which is what makes the legend toggles work.
 *
 * Output: one file per collection, public/maps/shared/sea-routes-<type>.json
 * (+ the data/atlas/shared canonical copies, byte-identical per the repo's
 * dual-copy discipline). Split rather than combined because AtlasShell already
 * fetches and paints per overlay key, so /atlas/yacht pulls 47 KB instead of
 * the full 443.

/*
 * WHEN A ROUTED LEG IS NOT A VOYAGE.
 *
 * Two kinds of leg come out of the router looking like sea routes and are not:
 *
 *   - transfers. Expedition itineraries list the charter flight and the coach
 *     between ships as consecutive "ports": Seattle -> Nome on the same day,
 *     Santiago -> Buenos Aires, Cusco -> Ollantaytambo. The router dutifully
 *     sails them — 4,400 km up the Pacific coast, 5,900 km round Cape Horn,
 *     790 km out to the coast of Peru and back.
 *   - mask artefacts. A strait narrower than a cell that the passages ledger
 *     does not (yet) reopen: Hamburg -> Cuxhaven down the Elbe was routed 1,093
 *     km round Denmark. And a bad geocode (Laugarvatn, Iceland, in the middle of
 *     a Chilean fjord cruise) produces a 14,000 km leg in a day.
 *
 * Both are caught by asking what a ship could actually do. PACE: no cruise
 * ship covers more than ~1,000 km a day, so a leg needing much more than that
 * between the days it is scheduled is not one the ship sails. DETOUR: a leg ten
 * times longer than the straight line between its ports is the router going
 * the long way round something it cannot see through. A merely long way round
 * (Genoa -> Venice is seven times the chord, and real) is only suspect when it
 * would also need an implausible pace.
 *
 * Such a leg keeps its two ports and loses the invented voyage: it is drawn as
 * a "transfer", a plain great circle the client renders as a faint connector,
 * which is what a flight or a coach between two calls should look like.
