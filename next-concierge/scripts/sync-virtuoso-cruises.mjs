// Pulls the sailings behind the three sea atlases — expedition, yacht and world
// cruise — from the Virtuoso API.
//
// The catalogue holds ~59,000 sailings, which is thirteen hours of detail calls
// and mostly river boats and mass-market ocean liners we do not carry. So the
// selection happens SERVER-side: each atlas is a set of cruise lines crossed
// with a cruise type or a length band, which the API filters natively
// (`cruiselines`, `cruisetypes`, `lengths` — all AND together). That takes the
// crawl from 59,000 to roughly 4,500. An atlas may be built from more than one
// selection, which is how a line the API types differently still reaches the
// right map (see Paul Gauguin below).
//
// The brand sets are deliberate editorial choices, not an accident of what was
// harvestable — the expedition atlas is expedition operators, the yacht atlas is
// the four true yacht brands. Widening them is a business decision; see
// CANDIDATES below for the lines that would qualify if we wanted them.
