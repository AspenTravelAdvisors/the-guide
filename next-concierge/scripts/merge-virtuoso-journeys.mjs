// Rebuilds the five journey atlases from the Virtuoso feeds.
//
//   data/atlas/shared/virtuoso-cruises.json  -> expedition, yacht, world cruise
//   data/atlas/shared/virtuoso-tours.json    -> private jet, rail
//
// Each atlas keeps its curated half. BRANDS, REGIONS and the hand-written
// operator blurbs come from the `.base.json` beside each feed and are never
// regenerated — the API has no opinion about how we group or describe our
// suppliers. What it does own is the sailings and departures themselves, their
// dates, their ships, and above all their day-by-day stops.
//
// THE POINT OF THE EXERCISE IS COORDINATES. Every stop the API returns carries
// the operator's own latitude and longitude. Until now those were geocoded from
// scraped place names, with the misses patched by hand in port-overrides.json
// and 712 of 3,542 expedition sailings left untraceable. Routes are drawn from
// these numbers, so better numbers are better routes everywhere at once.
//
// Writes BOTH copies of every dual-copy file (data/atlas/… and public/maps/…),
// because the server reads one and the browser fetches the other — the same
// rule scripts/fix-port-locations.mjs follows.
