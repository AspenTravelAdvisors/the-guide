/**
 * verify-photoreal — the engine switch, checked where a browser cannot help.
 *
 *   npm run verify:photoreal
 *
 * The photoreal engine can only be SEEN with a Google Maps key, live tiles and
 * a real browser. Three things about it can be proved without any of that, and
 * they are the three that break silently:
 *
 *   1. THE CAMERA HANDOFF. Switching engines has to preserve "where I am and
 *      how close I am", or the choice reads as a teleport and nobody uses it
 *      twice. Mapbox measures closeness in zoom levels over a tile pyramid and
 *      Google 3D measures it in metres of range, so the conversion is real
 *      arithmetic, and arithmetic can be checked. A round trip that drifts is
 *      the bug the traveller would report as "it jumps".
 *
 *   2. PIN PARITY. A pin's colour means a category, and the categories are
 *      defined in public/maps/hotel/index.html. This reads that table out of
 *      the standalone atlas and compares it to the port, so the two engines
 *      cannot quietly come to disagree about what a colour means — the same
 *      technique verify-hotels.mjs uses for the filter predicate.
 *
 *   3. THE DEEP-LINK CONTRACT. `engine=3d` has to survive a round trip through
 *      the parser and the writer, and `?hotel=` must NOT route back to the
 *      iframe it used to — that regression would look like nothing at all in
 *      review and would put the property view back behind a tab.
