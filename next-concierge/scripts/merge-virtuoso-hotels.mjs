 * What the gate compares: everything the supplier feeds decide, and nothing the

 *
 * Three fields here are derived from the date the merge runs rather than from
 * anything a supplier sent — `promotions` and `hasPromotion` filter offers on
 * today, and `perksStale` compares the benefit year against this one. So a merge
 * run the morning after an offer lapses, or on the first of January, produces a
 * different file from the one in git with no input having changed at all.
 *
 * Byte-comparing the two turned `npm run verify` red on its own — and while the
 * suite was an `&&` chain, that took every check after it down with it,
 * silently, for as long as nobody looked past the first failure. (The chain is
 * gone too; see scripts/verify-all.mjs.)
 *
 * So an expired offer is not staleness, and the gate holds the merge to the
 * parts the feeds actually own. Calendar drift is reported as the note it is.
 * Nothing is lost by that: `prebuild` re-runs this merge on every deploy, so the
 * live site is always filtered as of the build, not as of the last commit.
