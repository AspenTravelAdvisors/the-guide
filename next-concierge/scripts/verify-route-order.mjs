/**
 * verify-route-order — prove a traced route is drawn in itinerary order.
 *
 *   node scripts/verify-route-order.mjs
 *
 * ── What this is defending ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A traced route is not just a shape, it is a SEQUENCE: Monte-Carlo on day 1
 * through to Barcelona on day 8. The dash animation marches along that
 * sequence to show the direction of travel, and the camera frames its bounding
 * box, so both depend on frameRoute() handing back legs in the order the ship
 * sails them, each oriented the way it sails.
 *
 * That ordering used to be inferred from the geometry — start at the first
 * port, then repeatedly take the nearest unused leg-end — with the itinerary
 * consulted only to choose the first leg. It could not work, because the
 * distance threshold it leaned on had to be loose enough to forgive the gap
 * between a port's listed coordinate and where its leg actually begins, while
 * also being tight enough to tell two adjacent ports apart. Those ports can be
 * 5km apart (Nice and Villefranche-sur-Mer; Valletta and St. Julian's), so no
 * single value does both.
 *
 * The failure was not subtle. Yacht trip 243, Monte-Carlo to Barcelona, drew
 * days 3-8 and then appended days 1-2 running backwards; 46 of 362 yacht
 * itineraries did not begin on day 1 at all. frameRoute() now walks the
 * itinerary hop by hop instead of inferring it, and these assertions hold that
 * line: they are written against the SHIPPED data, so a regeneration of the sea
 * geometry that breaks the day-by-day fails here rather than on the map.
 *
 * The corpus assertions state the contract directly rather than inferring it
 * from whether the drawn line happens to be continuous: build the hops the
 * itinerary implies, keep those the geometry file can actually serve, and
 * require the route to open with exactly those, in that order, each oriented
 * the way the ship sails. Legs that match no hop are appended so geometry is
 * never dropped; they are counted and reported, not asserted on, because there
 * is no correct position for a leg the itinerary never asked for.
