/**
 * The crawlable surface, checked.
 *
 * Three things on this surface fail silently, which is the only reason this
 * file exists — every one of them ships a page that looks fine and is wrong:
 *
 *   1. A fact token that does not resolve. `{{hotels:program=Marriot STARS}}`
 *      (one 't') either renders the braces to the crawler or, in an earlier
 *      design, quietly rendered "0". Both are worse than a build failure, and
 *      neither shows up in a screenshot.
 *   2. An evidence query that matches nothing. The answer keeps its claim and
 *      loses the table under it — a page that says "the properties are listed
 *      below" above nothing at all.
 *   3. A capsule that is not a capsule. The whole value of the block is that it
 *      answers the question standing alone, in the length an engine will lift.
 *      A three-word capsule and a nine-sentence one both defeat it.
 *
 * It also re-derives every hotel URL, because a slug that changes is a 404 for
 * everyone who already had the link, and the sitemap now carries 2,240 of them.
